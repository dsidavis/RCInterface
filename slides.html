# Overview
+ Compilation, linking, shared libraries, loading
+ Make
+ R package
+ Debugging
+ configure and autoconf

---

# Why is Compile Code Faster

+ Consider 1 + 2
   + In R
   + In C

---
# Compiled Code
+ See Plus/plus.c

```
double plus0()
{
    return(1+2);
}
```

+ Machine Code
```
_plus0:
       0:	55 	pushq	%rbp
       1:	48 89 e5 	movq	%rsp, %rbp
       4:	f2 0f 10 05 4c 00 00 00 	movsd	76(%rip), %xmm0
       c:	5d 	popq	%rbp
       d:	c3 	retq
       e:	66 90 	nop
```

---
# More Complicated Version of plus0

```
double plus1()
{
    double ans;
    ans = 1;
    ans += 2;
    return(ans);
}
```

+ Exactly the same compiled code

---

# When to Use Compile Code

+ Avoid reimplementing existing code
  + there is an existing, reliable, maintained compiled routine or library

+ Speed is absolutely essential
  + Implement slow version
  + Profile
  + Implement only slow parts
  + Compare results with slow version to ensure correct.

---

# Calling a Routine

+ Two interfaces in R to C/C++ code
  + .C()
  + .Call()

+ .Call() more flexible.
  + .C() limited, but simple(r) when appropriate.

+ Can only call routines with specific signatures
  + Typically create wrapper routines
    + Called from R, convert and pass arguments to real C routine
 
+ Direct call possible with, e.g., rdyncall and Rffi.

+ Also .Fortran() and .External()
---

# .C()

+ Only accepts arrays from basic R types
  + logical, integer, numeric, character vectors
  + typically needs their lengths/number of elements
    + passed as an array of length 1!

+ result returned by filling in values in the argument(s)

---

# .C() example

+ In dotC/src

```
dyn.load("dotC.so")
z = as.numeric(1:100)
o = .C("add1", z, length(z), ans = numeric(length(z))) $ans
o
```

---
# .C() wrapper functions (in R)

+ R function to call the C routine
  + Coerce all of the arguments to expected type
  + name the result elements and extract them
    + can be more than one element containing results

```
add1 =
function(x)
{
  x = as.numeric(x)
  o = .C("add1", x, length(x), ans = numeric(length(x))) $ans
}
```

---
# "Compilation" Steps

+ Compile and convert source files top dynamic shared object (DSO)/DLL

+ R CMD SHLIB plus.c
+ R CMD SHLIB -o foo.so a.c b.c

+ Or compiled automatically in package installation.
  + R CMD INSTALL packageDirectory

+ Actually, several steps
  + Preprocessor
  + Compile to object code
  + Link object code to executable or DSO/DLL

+ Load DSO/DLL
  + dyn.load() in R
  + useDynLib() in NAMESPACE file of package.

+ Beauty of C/C++ is can fail at each step!

---

# Makevars file

+ Often need to specify compilation flags
+ Do this in Makevars

+ Don't specify compiler (CC),
  + allow user or central install override this
 

---
# Make

+ Purpose - created derived files
  + update specific files when one or more change
  + declared dependencies of one output on one or more inputs.
  +  DSOs from .c/.cpp files, compiling .o's and 

---

# .Call()

+ Pass arbitrary R objects to C routine
+ Return an R object.

+ Can examine the type of an argument
+ Can create new R objects

+ All R objects in C have type `SEXP`

+ C-level API to manipulate SEXPs
  + Query objects - type, length, dimensions, attributes and values/elements
  + Create new objects

---
# Accessing Values in R Objects

+ TYPEOF(robj) to determine what the R object is
  + like typeof() in R, but returns enumerated constant.

+ Access data portion with corresponding macro
  + arary of primitive values
  + LOGICAL() - int *
  + INTEGER() - int *
  + REAL()   - double *

+ Character vectors
   + STRING_ELT(robj, idx)
   + SET_STRING_ELT(robj, idx, value)
+ Lists
  + VECTOR_ELT(robj, idx)
  + SET_VECTOR_ELT(robj, idx, value)

# Rqpdf

----

# Matrices

+ Column-oriented vector
+ How to access m[i,j]?

---
# Creating New R Objects in C/C++

+ `allocVector(type, length)`
+ Macros, e.g., NEW_NUMERIC(), NEW_LIST()

---
# Garbage Collection (GC)

+ Since essentially working with R at the C-level,
  garbage collection can occur at any time in the C routine.

+ Need to mark local R objects as being used so not GC'ed.
  + PROTECT(obj) just after creating/modifying it
  + UNPROTECT(num) at the "end" of the routine, release &lt;num&gt; objects.

+ Use `gctorture(TRUE)` to debug C code.
  + Very slow, but worth it.

# External Pointer Objects

# Debugging Compiled Code in R

+ Need to be able to
  + stop at particular lines of code to explore
  + stop on crashes (segmentation faults) for post-mortem debugging.

+ Run R under the debugger
  + Debug R itself and
  + loaded C/C++ code in packages/dyn.load()

+ R -d lldb
+ R -d gdb

+ For lldb on OSX, I need to use the alias
```
command alias Rr process launch -v DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/duncan/R-devel/build/lib
```
to run the R process within the debugger.

---

# See Rqpdf at tag segFault

---
# Configuring Package Code

+ Need to provide machine-specific or local flags to compile C/C++ code
  + Location of include directories
  + pre-processor flags to enable/disable features in C/C++ code
  + library directories
+ Modify R code for particular installation
+ Allow package installer to customize package features and compilation

+ R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='.....'
  + `install.packages(, configure.args = c())`
